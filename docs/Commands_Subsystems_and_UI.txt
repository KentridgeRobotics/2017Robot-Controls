Commands, Subsystems, and UI components

AUTONOMOUS
----------
Gears
- Navigate to the gear goal
- Deposit gear
- Navigate to the gear pickup
- Repeat (if we're really fast)

COMMANDS
--------
Drive
- Set speeds, with inputs that are left stick and right stick (y-axis only), for tank-style driving
- Two joysticks
- Separate driver and gunner/gear grabber controls

Climb
- Climb rope
- stop (lock) when there is a light in front of me?
- stop (lock) when tension is too high?

Shoot
- Aim (auto?) (Currently only elevation, no turret)
- shoot (auto?)

Sweep up balls (front loader)
- Turn on/turn off
- Let driver control this

Gear grabber control
- XBox controller
- Multiple joints to control


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUBSYSTEMS
----------
Driving
- Set speeds for left and right drive wheel

Loading
- ?

Climbing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sensors

Camera
- Image detection, to recognize targets
	* There are vision targets surrounding the gear lift.
	* There are vision targets on the high fuel goal 
- Light detection, to see when goal light is lit (after climbing)
- Aiming? Maybe just show image to operator.

Compass
- Maybe we can use that. Do we get to calibrate before autonomous section?

Range finder?
- Is there something available? yes!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vision subsystem

Components

Shape finder

- Given an image look for a particular shape and color (or saturation) in the image
- Return the coordinates of the center of the shape
- Ideally, we'll want to convert these coordinates such that (0,0) in the image is the "forwards" direction for the robot,
  so having a target at x-coordinate 0 means that we can drive forward and eventually hit it.
