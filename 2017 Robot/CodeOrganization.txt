Code organization

First, let's make sure to not check in code that breaks the build for everyone else. So before you push your changes
to the "master" branch, make sure that you haven't broken anything. This means compiling the project, deploying it
to the robot, and verifying that any of the functions you're working on still work.

Second, let's organize our robot like this:

robot/commands/drive

	We want a "Drive.java" class in this directory, where we specify what happens in response to
	joystick input. Do we need anything else here?

	
robot/commands/auto

	Put all the autonomous commands under this directory. These are the programs that we can run
	in autonomous mode. We should write several of these, and we can pick one to use during
	a competition. Some examples: 
	
	AutoDriveOverBaseline:
		a program that just moves the robot over the baseline.
		
	AutoDropOffGear:
		A program that navigates to the gear lifter and drops off the gear. 
		
	AutoShooter:
		A program that moves into the shooting area and shoots baskets.
	
robot/commands/shooter

	Put all the commands related to operation of the shooter here. Probably commands for raise/lower the aim,
	control the shooter motor.
	
robot/commands/grabber

	Put all commands related to operation of the gear grabber here. Probably commands for raise/lower the
	grabber arm, open or close the servo to grab the gear, move the arm to certain preset positions.
	
robot/commands/macro

	This is where we put all the command groups for doing complex operations as a single command that
	we can assign to a button. For
	example:
	
	Shoot a basket
		- Move the robot to the perfect position for shooting a basket
		- Raise or lower the aim to whatever we've determined is correct
			for shooting from this position
		- Rev up the shooter motor to the correct speed
		- Take the shot.
		
robot/config

	This is where we put all the constants for specifying the IDs for the various controllers in RobotMap.java.
	We also put code for setting up the operator interface (SmartDashboard) in OI.java
	
robot/subsystems/

	This is where we actually control the hardware. Some classes inside this are:
	
	DriveTrain
		Control the drive motors.
		
	Shooter
		Control the shooter's motor, aim, and shot
		
	GearGrabber
		Control the gear grabber's arm and servo mechanism.
		
	Climber
		Control the climber's motor
		
	BallCollector
		Control the ball collector's motors.
